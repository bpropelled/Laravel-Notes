# Artisan Notes

Artisan is Laravels main development tool.  Artisan can help easily generate **Controllers, Models, Migrations, Seeds, Tests** and many others based on simple templates so we don't have to start from scratch.

Artisan is also helpful by having a built in server to deploy a local laravel application, run database migrations, clear application cache.\Mockery\Fixtures\(

    ## Run the Web Server using Artisan
    ```cmd 
    php artisan serve 
    ```

    ## Put the application in **Maintenance Mode**
    ```cmd 
    php artisan down 
    ```

    ## Take the application out of maintenance mode 
    ```cmd 
    php artisan up 
    ```
